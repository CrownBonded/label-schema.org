# label-schema.org

When we started label-schema, the intention was to provide a single set of common labeling conventions for container images. Since the OCI has defined a parallel set of similar conventions in the [OCI Image Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) (known as [annotations](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/annotations.md) rather than labels) it makes sense to consolidate efforts in one place. 

This project is no longer actively maintained. Visit http://label-schema.org for more information about the legacy label-schema project, and go to the [OCI Image Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) for future label definitions.
